Part 1: HTML5 + SASS

I tried to recreate the Figma design, making use the benefits of flexbox layout. Trying to keep it simple an clean, I used the less code I could, with special attention to the footer's mobile nav. This page was tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and IE11. Unfortunately I couldn't test it in Safari (my Macbook died recently). It is viewed OK in desktop and mobile visualization, with some details in "tablet" such as header image or slider height. 

I recently start using Visual Studio for coding, with the help of some plugins such as Live SASS Compiler for compli CSS. But I could config some Gulp tasks or using the tools you work with to compile on TravelPerk.

If is there anything you need to know, just ask me ;)
